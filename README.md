CHAPTER 1 PROJECT PROPOSAL

Introduction
School Management system, required for effective software development, to manage the overall data of a school

Vision and Business Case
In the offline system, it is an overhead to keep the records related to faculty, student, parents, and other school staff on the papers. Everything related to their progress in the system is marked manually. For example A report of a student‚Äôs attendance is generated monthly is shown to his/her parents. Now, a regular student, going to school every day, is marked absent for a day by mistake.
It is a burden to take out the register and view the records. As you can see, it is a very time-consuming process and it costs much. So, I thought why I should not help these young guns of the nations to help them to have a bright future and to make an online centralized platform that can be accessed from anywhere in the world.
My other aim is to minimize the paperwork as minimum as I can so that there is no need to cut more and more trees. Indirectly, I will be helping Mother Nature.
Use-Case Model
	The functional requirements of school management system are:
1.	Multi-User Account System
2.	Student Fee Management
3.	Parent Monitoring Feature
4.	Homework Document
5.	Class Routine Schedule
6.	Profile System
7.	Exam Marks Management
8.	Chart & Graph Analysis of Exams
9.	Daily Attendance
10.	Internal Messaging

Supplementary Specification
1.	Events management

Glossary
Having a dynamic system with a bird view of data and reports can give next level of power and quickness in decision-making for principal or management person. School management System provides extra ordinary Management Dashboard and data reporting functions along with dynamic access rights mechanism which becomes a blessing for management personnel.

Risk List & Risk Management Plan
Describes the risks (business, technical, resource, schedule) and ideas for their mitigation or response. 
1. Malware
Digital hackers are watching your every move and trick you to download malware and take control of your computer remotely. They use malware to attack computer networks to perpetrate crimes.  Fraudsters use virus, malware, spyware, spams, and phishing to gain access to your sensitive personal information and commit financial crimes. Defend your data against malware through secure servers, whether physical or in cloud, and shield against vulnerabilities.  
2. Theft & Loss
Unauthorized users without permissions who have access to sensitive data can cause harm to educational institutions as a result of theft. There is a risk of the sensitive academic data will be leaked by staff. It becomes easy to lose your storage media with backup data due to misplacement or theft. When you suffer data loss due to various incidents such as mechanical damage, power failure, software crash, disasters or loss of your laptops and mobile devices, it is another way of inadvertent data exposure. Keep all your data safe and secure using role-based access control to ensure confidentiality and privacy.       
3. Unsafe data
If adequate safety precautions are not taken when files and documents are shared in website, smartphones and tablets via internet networks, the information contained on them might gain access to the devices and get exposed to risks. We can make use of cloud deployments to manage the education system better and better.
4. Negligence
When data is stored in computers or laptops, it has become so natural that people lose the information when files are accidentally deleted or even it could fall into the wrong hands. Ensure a proper backup strategy to keep your data on important devices and run them smoothly without hassles.


















CHAPTER 2 USE CASES
Use Case Diagram
 Brief Level Use 





Brief level use case:

Exams marks would be marked automatically by the system but if teacher wants to change or over write he/she has access to do that. Students have access to upload file for assignments.
Afaq (FA20-BSE-057)
Use Case: Time Table
In school management system time table is necessary so it is strong entity. From time table students can see their time table and takes classes according to their time table slot.
